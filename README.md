# DSA Website

> Gatsby-based static site generator

---

## Local development

First, clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:dsa504/dsa504-website
```

Next, get the values for a `.env` file from an organization administrator. Once
that file is created, you can download dependencies with `yarn install` and start
the server with `yarn start`.

The website can then be viewed at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

## Testing

Check code style with `yarn lint`. Tests can be run with `yarn test`, but for now
there are no unit or end-to-end tests.

## Deployment

TBD
